    "- Question 9: I wasn't exactly sure on this one. Initially I thought it would just be (int)(Math.random()*6) + (int)(Math.random()*6) but then I talked to aiden and realized that we might have to add 2 if it only floors the numbers, since we would be getting a random number from 0 to 5 rather than 1 to 6. I then tested it below to figure out that it always rounds down, so we do have to add 2.\n",
    "- Question 10: we knew the answer to this question, but this sparked a discussion about the difference between a class and an interface. We learned that multiple interfaces can be implemented by a single class while only one class can be extended, and the interfaces only contain static variables and abstract methods. \n",
    "- Question 18: I wasn't sure how order of operations works so I tested it myself below. Turns out the question was actually about integer rounding, I didn't even think of it but by first dividing 404/10, we would actually get 40 not 404. This is because 404 and 10 are integers so our answer should be an integer value. \n",
    "- Question 22: We weren't sure about this one at first either, but we realized that we missed the fact that E doesn't work since it goes the wrong way, iterating through the rows first before the columns meaning it would give 142536 instead of 123456. \n"
