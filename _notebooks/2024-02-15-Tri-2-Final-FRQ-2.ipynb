    "This FRQ was mainly about a few of the basic java concepts like contains and even nested if statements. The FRQ had a branching logic chain, in which one answer led to false and another led to a second if statement. This was interesting to work with and is a useful concept to understand, and I feel I have a solid understanding of it. However, looking back, I can see why some programmers prefer an alternate syntax where you ask for the negative and then return earlier in order to avoid large chains of nested functions or if statements. It would have made my code more readable to check if instead if the word did not contain the letter and then just checked if the exact letter matched up, rather than checking both seperately. "
