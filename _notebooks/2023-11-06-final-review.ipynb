    "## Websocket\n",
    "The websocket was a struggle. It definitely took me the longest to get working and I may have been in a little over my head. However, after probably around 11 hours of work, I got the websocket functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first thing I did was update the configuration files and create a branch for my websocket. [Here](https://github.com/aidenhuynh/cj_backend/commit/2044e017aa81d54471e655d274595a54a7fc48cc) is the commit for that. \n",
    "2. Then my first websocket didn't work and after not being able to figure it out for a few hours I started over from the beginning and followed a different video tutorial. \n",
    "3. Then I realized the issue was CORS allowed origins, and after not being able to figure out why the header had a duplicate \"allowed-origins\" entry, I asked Rohan Juneja and he helped me figure it out. Turns out the origins were defined within the nginx configuration and within the backend.\n",
    "4. Eventually I got it all working. Below are a few of the java files from my websocket. "

This part was much smoother than the websocket so honestly it's not as interesting, but essentially you create a unique code and then use that code in a fetch request to the Spotify API to verify that you can use the spotify login, which the user then completes which sends an authorization token back through the frontend.
