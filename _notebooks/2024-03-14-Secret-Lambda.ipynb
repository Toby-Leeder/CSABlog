    "# Part 1: Secrets\n",
    "Generating the Secret is pretty self explanatory. You just need to create a key/value pair. You can use the default encryption key. You also have to assign a secret name. I followed the example given, using \"prod/github/issues\" (prod for production). \n",
    "\n",
    "Secrets manager itself seems very cool. You can configure automatically rotating secrets which are generated via custom Lambda functions. You can essentially customize as much or as little as you want, and AWS is overall full of great services. You can learn more about it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) if you'd like. \n",
    "\n",
    "The secret manager also gives you an example of code you could use in your Lambda function in multiple languages, for which I've included the python version below. boto3 is the library used to access AWS secrets by creating a \"session\" and then using the secrets manager within that session. The rest should be pretty self explanatory. "

In short, Lambdas allow you to run code segments without a server, sorta like how you can run a jupyter notebook cell without a server needing to be deployed. They are useful for many different applications, and in our case they're helping us keep our secret key safe by finding the key in the AWS Secrets for us and sending it to our frontend server. \n",

The Lambda is automatically assigned a role, and it's fine to just use that role, but make sure you add permissions by going to the IAM page, clicking on the roles tab on the left sidebar, searching for you role, and adding the permissions policy.
