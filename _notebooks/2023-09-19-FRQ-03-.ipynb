    "\n",
    "1. ChatGPT is very very very useful\n",
    "2. ArrayList<MemberInfo(closed bracket doesn't work). This syntax is used to create an arraylist object. An arraylist is an array-like data structure that can store objects. MemberInfo is the type of object that it can store. I didn't know this syntax beforehand.\n",
    "3. I also learned what a stringArray was. String[] is just an array of strings. I had never seen it before though\n",
    "4. I learned some syntax for working with different data types, like .add(object) and .get(index) for arraylists and .length() for stringArrays\n",
    "5. I also learned this syntax \"for (String n : names)\". It reminded me of a forEach() loop in javascript. It esssentially iterates through each String in the stringArray called names. I later used this after learning about it in part b"
