## Key Commits

### Websocket
I know you've heard a lot about my websocket, but I feel like I haven't really given myself the credit I should have, since this took me soooo long to get right. It just would not work for hours and hours and hours and I had to remake the entire thing from scratch twice just to finally get it functional. Looking back at it though It's suprisingly simple, even compared to some of the basic API stuff we're working on. This was a long time coming though, something I've been wanting to do since last year, and I'm really glad I finally got an opportunity to finally use it in a project after you introduced it to me over a year ago after I showed you my chess project.

p.s. the commit is pretty bad, I tested it locally until it worked so I just comitted all of it at once.

### Spotify API
This was another new skill that I learned this year. This was the first time that I tried connecting to an API with different authorization flows and secret keys and all of the other security measures. It was really interesting learning about it and figure out how it all worked, and seeing my computer actually change what's playing on my phone was very cool to see.

### CSS Animations
Another first for me, CSS has always been something I'm a little weaker on so I appreciated the opportunity to use it for our sorting project. I created an animation to represent the sorting algorithm being ran. It procedurally determines the distances that the entries in the list have to move, so it's dynamic and automatically works with different size lists.

### Sorting Backend
The commit I chose for the backend was the time analysis aspect. Though it was a good opportunity for me to use the spring static api backend rather than my websocket which are pretty different, I specfically chose this one about time analysis since I think that was the crux of the project. The structure we chose with objects that contain the average time of each run was created for the purpose of this analysis, and it was interesting to compare the different sorts even though we kind of took the project in the wrong direction due to not coming to review that one day.

## College Board Prep
My previous Java knowledge has helped me to feel pretty comfortable with most of the collegeboard concepts, and here are my MCQs showing my abilities. Here are my collegeboard blogs.

## Organization/planning

Honestly I'm still lacking in this department. I do have a [time box](https://toby-leeder.github.io/CSABlog/ToC) which I use but my blog is much emptier than I wish it was. I have a plan though to improve this, and I'm gonna talk about this later but that's actually something I'm really looking forward too this year. I've already created two issues, one for [individual tasks](https://github.com/John-sCC/jcc_frontend/issues/2) and one for [group goals](https://github.com/John-sCC/jcc_frontend/issues/1) both to be used on a weekly basis in order to keep everyone on track and on the same page. We are planning on combining this with the [scrum board](https://github.com/users/aidenhuynh/projects/4) system similar to what we did for our last project to create a succesful and productive environment for the entire group which captures both the big picture goals and the smaller details of the project. 

## Github Commits
[Here](https://github.com/Toby-Leeder?tab=overview&from=2023-12-01&to=2023-12-31) is a link to my commits. Unfortunatly I think this kind of highlights my bad habits, I tend to do big commits sporatically, rather than small consistent commits. I'm still working on commiting without syncing, which I think will help with my commit frequency. 

## Project
I'm excited to do something that will actually leave an impact on the school. I look forward to seeing our project being used by someone in the future. I also look forward to working with Drew Reed actually. I've seen that Drew Reed is able to lift group members up, and that's something that I want to be able to do in the future. I hope that I can learn from and work with him to see how he's able to do what he does and what I can emulate to be more succesful myself. I've already noticed that he's highly motivated and communicates frequently, and I look forward to seeing what else I can learn.
