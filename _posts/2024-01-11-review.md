## College Board Prep
My previous Java knowledge has helped me to feel pretty comfortable with most of the collegeboard concepts, and here are my MCQs showing my abilities.




## Organization/planning

Honestly I'm still lacking in this department. I do have a [time box](https://toby-leeder.github.io/CSABlog/ToC) which I use but my blog is much emptier than I wish it was. I have a plan though to improve this, and I'm gonna talk about this later but that's actually something I'm really looking forward too this year. I've already created two issues, one for [individual tasks](https://github.com/John-sCC/jcc_frontend/issues/2) and one for [group goals](https://github.com/John-sCC/jcc_frontend/issues/1) both to be used on a weekly basis in order to keep everyone on track and on the same page. We are planning on combining this with the [scrum board](https://github.com/users/aidenhuynh/projects/4) system similar to what we did for our last project to create a succesful and productive environment for the entire group which captures both the big picture goals and the smaller details of the project.
