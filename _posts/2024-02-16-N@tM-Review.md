### Things I saw at the N@tM

This was a project that I thought was very cool. I always wanted to create a game in this class and though I wasn't able to this year, it's cool to see others creating something. Though there's very strong "inspiration" from a certain franchise, it's still cool to see people creating something. The art that isn't stolen is very interesting, though I agree with a recomendation they recieved which is that they should use generative AI to create images they can use for their project.

One thing I saw outside of computer science that I thought was interesting was this project. It's a 3d animation project and it was actually created by one of my students at Mathnaisum. I thought it was really cool to see some of her work, and I like gravity falls book as well as the jars in the back where she clearly showed what she learned in the project and how she learned to modify various aspects of her model. 3d animtion is also a field that inherently requires a lot of math even if the users don't realize it, so it was cool to see a student who's not the biggest fan of math actually using it in the real world.
