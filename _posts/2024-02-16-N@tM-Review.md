### Planning for next trimester
Throughout the Night at the Museum we recorded the feedback we recieved. Most of the feedback was about the user experience, so those are a lot of the changes we plan to make to the project. For example, we recieved feedback that the colors could be customizable in order to ensure accessibility for colorblind users. We also discussed how we could better organize some pages like our assignments and our image recognition. A lot of the features were kind of barebones, so we are still working to improve the functionality and look of features as well. Overall it was beneficial to get this input even this early on into the project and I'm thankful we had the opportunity. 

### Our team
Our demo went pretty well overall. Unfortunately, my part of the project broke right before I could show it to the users, so that was a bummer. Everything else worked as intended though, and we were able to kinda create an assembly line to show off each of our features. Overall the presentation went well and I'm lucky to be in a team of so many capable members!

### Things I saw at the N@tM

This was a project that I thought was very cool. I always wanted to create a game in this class and though I wasn't able to this year, it's cool to see others creating something. Though there's very strong "inspiration" from a certain franchise, it's still cool to see people creating something. The art that isn't stolen is very interesting, though I agree with a recomendation they recieved which is that they should use generative AI to create images they can use for their project.

One thing I saw outside of computer science that I thought was interesting was this project. It's a 3d animation project and it was actually created by one of my students at Mathnaisum. I thought it was really cool to see some of her work, and I like gravity falls book as well as the jars in the back where she clearly showed what she learned in the project and how she learned to modify various aspects of her model. 3d animtion is also a field that inherently requires a lot of math even if the users don't realize it, so it was cool to see a student who's not the biggest fan of math actually using it in the real world.
