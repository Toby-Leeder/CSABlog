# Agile Manifesto

### 1

Our highest priority is to demonstrate our learning and progress.

### 2 

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.

### 3 

Ensure that all members of the group are motivated and passionate. Create an environment where they feel safe to learn and improve in order to create a better final product

### 4

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is through face to face communication, particularly in standing meetings away from other distractions. 

### 5

Working software is the primary measure of progress. 

### 6

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. This requires a continuous focus on improvement and learning. 

### 7

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
