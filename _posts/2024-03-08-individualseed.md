# Project Contributions
I finished the QR Code program this week so I can now start on something new. I did this by fixing a tiny bug explained in my [debugging](https://github.com/Toby-Leeder/CSABlog/issues/6) issue. [Here](url) is the commit: https://github.com/John-sCC/jcc_frontend/commit/3f7a89f3811e9b4e74a6f864b7876a0f9b98f850. I also created a system to automatically change the backend link depending on whether the site is running locally or not, linked [here](https://github.com/John-sCC/jcc_frontend/commit/073a0aeeaf5e34dcae98162faf8d82efb152db87). [Here](https://toby-leeder.github.io/CSABlog//2024/03/07/QRCode-Retrospective_IPYNB_2_.html) is the blog I created about this part of the project. 

# Team Management

For this team I have become the manager of one of the "trios" (it actually has 4 people but it's alright). I have worked to improve the discord and other communication channels along with Aiden, as well as ensuring that my team is on track with frequent checkins and by constantly being available to support them. [Here](https://john-scc.github.io/jcc_frontend/2024/03/07/planning_blog.html) is a link to our group blog in which I outlined the communication.
